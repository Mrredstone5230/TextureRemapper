# TextureRemapper

**IMPORTANT: THIS PROGRAM WAS MADE ON AND FOR MACOS. I DO NOT KNOW IF IT WORKS ON LINUX/WINDOWS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK** (If you make a good for tho I might add it here !)

This is a java program that can create ressourcepacks from default minecraft paths and create another pack with custom images, but with the same names.
The program is separated in 2 parts: Analyze and Apply

### Analyze
The analyzing process is pretty simple. First, execute the program with the "analyze" argument. Then, you will be asked to put the original folder location (Basically the default vanilla pack). You will soon have a massive console output. Starting at the number (should be the first line), copy and save it somewhere to prepare for the next part of the program.

### Apply
The applying process is also simple, but has more arguments. First, execute the program with the "apply" argument. Then, you have to enter the path for the images folder. After that, you need to enter the path of the output folder. Finally, you have to put the output of the Analyze process, and that's it !

### Executing the program
1. Download the latest build on the releases page
2. Have at least JDK 1.8 installed on your computer
3. Open a console
4. Execute "java -jar path-to-jar argument" (path-to-jar being where the downloaded file is.)
